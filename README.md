Quantum key distribution (QKD) enables a secure communication between two parties using the principles of Quantum Physics. The BB84 protocol, one of the first protocols in QKD, is effective not just for sharing keys but also for detecting eavesdropping. The paper simulated a computational model of QKD, analysing error rates under varying conditions of the number of bits (n). Using Python-based simulation, this paper simulated key exchanges for n = 10, n = 100, n = 1000 bits. We also incorporated a 0.02 noise probability to simulate real-world conditions for both with and without eavesdropping. Each scenario was repeated over 1000 trials to obtain an average error rate. Our results show that, without eavesdropping, the average error rate remains close to 2%, showcasing BB84â€™s stability against small noise. In the presence of an eavesdropper, the average error rate consistently exceeds 26%. Moreover, the standard deviation of error increases as n decreases, indicating higher variability in smaller datasets. While this study focuses on computational validation, the future work will extend towards building a low-cost experimental setup using basic optical tools.
